\title{Aggregate reflectance spectra}
\usage{
aggspec(rspecdata, by = NULL, FUN = mean, trim = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{rspecdata}{(required) a data frame, possibly of class \code{rspec}, which
contains a column containing a wavelength range, named 'wl', and spectra
data in remaining columns.}

\item{by}{(required) either a single value specifying the range of spectra
within the data frame to be combined (for example, \code{by} = 3 indicates the
function will be applied to groups of 3 consecutive columns in the spectra
data frame); a vector containing identifications for the columns in the
spectra data frame (in which case the function will be applied to each
group of spectra sharing the same identification); or a list of vectors,
e.g., \code{by = list(sex, species)}.}

\item{FUN}{the function to be applied to the groups of spectra. (defaults to
\code{\link[=mean]{mean()}})}

\item{trim}{logical. if \code{TRUE} (default), the function will try to identify
and remove numbers at the end of the names of the columns in the new rspec
object.}
}
\value{
A data frame of class \code{rspec} containing the spectra after applying
the aggregating function.
}
\description{
Combines spectra (by taking the average, for example) according to an index
or a vector of identities.
}
\examples{
data(teal)

# Average every two spectra
teal.sset1 <- aggspec(teal, by = 2)
plot(teal.sset1)

# Create factor and average spectra by levels 'a' and 'b'
ind <- rep(c("a", "b"), times = 6)
teal.sset2 <- aggspec(teal, by = ind)

plot(teal.sset2)
