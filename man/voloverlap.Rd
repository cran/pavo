\title{Color volume overlap}
\usage{
voloverlap(tcsres1, tcsres2, plot = FALSE, interactive = FALSE,
  col = c("blue", "red", "darkgrey"), new = TRUE, montecarlo = FALSE,
  nsamp = 1000, psize = 0.001, lwd = 1, view = 70, scale.y = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{tcsres1, tcsres2}{(required) data frame, possibly a result from the \code{colspace} 
function, containing
values for the 'x', 'y' and 'z' coordinates as columns (labeled as such)}

\item{plot}{logical. Should the volumes and points be plotted? (defaults to \code{FALSE})}

\item{interactive}{logical. If \code{TRUE}, uses the rgl engine for interactive plotting;
if \code{FALSE} then a static plot is generated.}

\item{col}{a vector of length 3 with the colors for (in order) the first volume, 
the second volume, and the overlap.}

\item{new}{logical. Should a new plot window be called? If \code{FALSE}, volumes and their
overlap are plotted over the current plot (defaults to \code{TRUE}).}

\item{montecarlo}{logical. If \code{TRUE}, Monte Carlo simulation is used instead of exact
solution (not recommended; defaults to \code{FALSE})}

\item{nsamp}{if \code{montecarlo = TRUE}, determines the number of points to be sampled.}

\item{psize}{if \code{montecarlo = TRUE} and \code{plot = TRUE}, sets the size to plot the points
used in the Monte Carlo simulation.}

\item{lwd}{if \code{plot = TRUE}, sets the line width for volume grids.}

\item{view, scale.y}{additional arguments used when using a static plot
(see \code{\link{vol}}).}
}
\value{
Calculates the overlap between the volumes defined by two set of points in
colorspace. The volume from the overlap is then given relative to:
\itemize{
\item \code{vsmallest} the volume of the overlap divided by the smallest of that defined 
by the the two input sets of color points. Thus, if one of the volumes is entirely 
contained within the other, this overlap will be \code{vsmallest = 1}.
 \item \code{vboth} the volume of the overlap divided by the combined volume of both 
input sets of color points.
}

The Monte Carlo solution is available mostly for legacy and benchmarking, and is not recommended
(see notes). If used, the output will be different:
\itemize{
	\item \code{s_in1, s_in2} the number of sampled points that fall within each of the volumes 
individually.
	\item \code{s_inboth} the number of sampled points that fall within both volumes.
	\item \code{s_ineither} the number of points that fall within either of the volumes.
	\item \code{psmallest} the proportion of points that fall within both volumes divided by the 
 number of points that fall within the smallest volume.
\item \code{pboth} the proportion of points that fall within both volumes divided by the total 
 number of points that fall within both volumes.
}

If the Monte Carlo solution is used, a number of points much greater than the default should be
considered (Stoddard & Stevens(2011) use around 750,000 points, but more or fewer might be required
depending on the degree of overlap).

\description{
Calculates the overlap between the volumes defined by two sets of points in cartesian
space.
}
\note{
Stoddard & Stevens (2011) originally obtained the volume overlap through Monte Carlo
simulations of points within the range of the volumes, and obtaining the frequency of 
simulated values that fall inside the volumes defined by both sets of color points.

Here we present an exact solution based on finding common vertices to both volumes
and calculating its volume. However, we also the Monte Carlo solution is available through
the \code{montecarlo=TRUE} option.

Stoddard & Stevens (2011) also return the value of the overlap relative to one of
the volumes (in that case, the host species). However, for other applications
this value may not be what one expects to obtain if (1) the two 
volumes differ considerably in size, or (2) one of the volumes is entirely contained
within the other. For this reason, we also report the volume relative to the union of
the two input volumes, which may be more adequate in most cases.
