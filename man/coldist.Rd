\usage{
coldist(modeldata, noise = c("neural", "quantum"), subset = NULL,
  achro = TRUE, qcatch = NULL, n = c(1, 2, 2, 4), weber = 0.1,
  weber.ref = "longest", weber.achro = 0.1, v, n1, n2, n3, n4)
}
\arguments{
\item{modeldata}{(required) quantum catch color data. Can be the result
from \code{\link{vismodel}}, or \code{\link{colspace}}. Data may also be independently calculated quantum catches, 
in the form of a data frame with columns representing photoreceptors.}

\item{noise}{how the noise will be calculated. (Ignored for \code{colspace} objects
 if model is not a receptor noise model (i.e. hexagon, colour-opponent-coding, 
categorical, and cielab models)):
\itemize{
    \item \code{neural}: noise is proportional to the Weber fraction and 
 is independent of the intensity of the signal received (i.e. assumes bright conditions).
    \item \code{quantum}: noise is the sum of the neural noise and receptor noise, 
 and is thus proportional to the Weber fraction and inversely proportional 
 to the intensity of the signal received (the quantum catches). 
 Note that the \code{quantum} option will only work with 
    objects of class \code{vismodel}.
}}

\item{subset}{If only some of the comparisons should be returned, a character vector of 
length 1 or 2 can be provided, indicating which samples are desired. The subset vector 
must match the labels of the imput samples, but partial matching (and regular expressions) 
are supported.}

\item{achro}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, last column of the data frame is used to calculate 
the achromatic contrast, with noise based on the Weber fraction given by the argument
\code{weber.achro}.
If the data are from the hexagon model (i.e. \code{colspace(space = 'hexagon')}), it 
instead returns long (or 'green') receptor contrast.}

\item{qcatch}{if the object is of class \code{vismodel} or \code{colspace}, 
 this argument is ignored. If the object is a data frame of quantal catches 
 from another source, this argument is used to specify what type of quantum catch is being 
 used, so that the noise can be calculated accordingly: 
\itemize{
 \item \code{Qi}: Quantum catch for each photoreceptor
 \item \code{fi}: Quantum catch according to Fechner law (the signal of the receptor
   channel is proportional to the logarithm of the quantum catch)
 }}

\item{n}{photoreceptor densities for the cones used in visual modeling.
must have same length as number of columns (excluding achromatic receptor if used;
defaults to 
the Pekin robin \emph{Leiothrix lutea} densities: \code{c(1,2,2,4)}). 
Ignored for \code{colspace} objects
if model is not a receptor noise model (i.e. hexagon, colour-opponent-coding, 
categorical, and cielab models).}

\item{weber}{The Weber fraction to be used. The noise-to-signal ratio \code{v} is unknown, 
 and therefore must be calculated based on the epirically estimated Weber 
 fraction of one of the cone classes. \code{v} is then applied to estimate the 
 Weber fraction of the other cones. by default, the value of 0.1 is used 
 (the empirically estimated value for the
 LWS cone from \emph{Leiothrix lutea}). Ignored for \code{colspace} objects
 if model is not a receptor noise model (i.e. hexagon, colour-opponent-coding, 
categorical, and cielab models).}

\item{weber.ref}{the cone class used to obtain the empirical estimate of the 
 Weber fraction used for the \code{weber} argument. By default, \code{n4} is used, 
 representing the LWS cone for \emph{Leiothrix lutea}. Ignored for \code{colspace} objects
 if model is not a receptor noise model (i.e. hexagon, colour-opponent-coding, 
categorical, and cielab models).}

\item{weber.achro}{the Weber fraction to be used to calculate achromatic contrast, when 
 \code{achro = TRUE}. Defaults to 0.1. Ignored for \code{colspace} objects
 if model is not a receptor noise model (i.e. hexagon, colour-opponent-coding, 
categorical, and cielab models).}

\item{n1, n2, n3, n4, v}{deprecated arguments. see below.}
}
\value{
A data frame containing up to 4 columns. 
The first two (\code{patch1, patch2}) refer
to the two colors being contrasted; \code{dS} is the chromatic contrast (delta S)
and \code{dL} is the achromatic contrast (delta L). Units are JND's in the receptor-noise
model, euclidean distances in the hexagon, cielab, and categorical colorspaces, 
and manhattan distances in the color-opponent-coding space.
}
\description{
Calculates color distances. When data are the result of \code{\link{vismodel}}, 
it applies the receptor-noise model of Vorobyev et al. (1998) to calculate color distances
with noise based on relative photoreceptor densities. It also accepts \code{\link{colspace}} data 
from the hexagon, colour-opponent-coding, categorical, and cielab models, in which case euclidean
distances (hexagon, cielab, categorical) or manhattan distances (coc) are returned.
}
\section{Note on previous versions}{

previous versions of \code{coldist} calculated receptor noise using the arguments
\code{v} for the individual cone noise-to-signal ratio and \code{n1,n2,n3,n4} for
the relative cone densities. These arguments have been replaced by \code{weber} and 
\code{n}, which takes a vector of relative cone densities. \code{weber.ref} allows
the user to specify which receptor to use as the reference to obtain the 
desired Weber fraction, and \code{coldist} calculates internally the value of \code{v}
to be used when calculating the Weber fraction for the remaining cones. 

This allows
a more explicit choice of Weber fraction, without the need to find the right value of
\code{v} to use in order to obtain the desired signal-to-noise ratio. Additionally,
by allowing \code{n} to be entered as a vector, \code{coldist} can now handle visual
systems with more than four photoreceptors.

In addition, the achromatic noise is calculated based on the \code{weber.achro} 
argument directly, and not based on \code{v} and \code{n4} as before.
