\usage{
  coldist(vismodeldata, qcatch = c("Qi", "fi"),
    vis = c("tetra", "tri", "di"),
    noise = c("neural", "quantum"), subset = NULL,
    achro = TRUE, n1 = 1, n2 = 2, n3 = 2, n4 = 4, v = 0.1)
}
\arguments{
  \item{vismodeldata}{(required) quantum catch color data.
  Can be either the result from \code{\link{vismodel}} or
  independently calculated data (in the form of a data
  frame with four columns, representing the avian cones).}

  \item{qcatch}{if the object is of class \code{vismodel},
  such as one generated using \code{pavo}, this argument is
  ignored. If the object is a data frame of quantal catches
  from another source, this argument is used to specify
  what type of quantum catch is being used, so that the
  noise can be calculated accordingly: \itemize{ \item
  \code{Qi}: Quantum catch for each photoreceptor (default)
  \item \code{fi}: Quantum catch according to Fechner law
  (the signal of the receptor channel is proportional to
  the logarithm of the quantum catch) }}

  \item{vis}{visual system phenotype to use in the model:
  \itemize{ \item \code{tetra}: Tetrachromatic color vision
  (default) \item \code{tri}: Trichromatic color vision
  \item \code{di}: Dichromatic color vision #\item
  \code{mono}: Monochromatic vision }}

  \item{subset}{If only some of the comparisons should be
  returned, a character vector of length 1 or 2 can be
  provided, indicating which samples are desired. The
  subset vector must match the labels of the imput samples,
  but partial matching (and regular expressions) are
  supported.}

  \item{achro}{logical. If \code{TRUE}, last column of the
  data frame is used to calculate the achromatic contrast,
  with noise based on the Weber fraction calculated using
  \code{n4}}

  \item{n1,n2,n3,n4}{tetrachromatic photoreceptor densities
  for u, s, m & l (default to blue tit \emph{Cyanistes
  caeruleus} densities: 1:2:2:4). If \code{vis} does not
  equal \code{'tetra'}, only \code{n1} and \code{n2}
  (\code{vis='di'}) or \code{n1}, \code{n2} and \code{n3}
  (\code{vis='tri'}) are used for chromatic contrast (NOTE:
  \code{n4} is still the value used for the achromatic
  contrast.)}

  \item{v}{Noise-to-signal ratio of a single cone (defaults
  to 0.1, so that under the default densities, the Weber
  fraction for the large cone will be 0.05, as estimated
  from behavioral experiment with the Perkin robin,
  \emph{Leiothrix lutea})}

  \item{noise}{how the noise will be calculated: \itemize{
  \item \code{neural}: noise is proportional to the Weber
  fraction and is independent of the intensity of the
  signal received.  \item \code{quantum}: noise is the sum
  of the neural noise and receptor noise, and is thus
  proportional to the Weber fraction and inversely
  proportional to the intensity of the signal received (the
  quantum catches). Note that the \code{quantum} option
  will only work with objects of class \code{vismodel}. }}
}
\value{
  A data frame containing 4 columns. The first two
  (\code{patch1, patch2}) refer to the two colors being
  contrasted; \code{dS} is the chromatic contrast (delta S,
  in JNDs) and \code{dL} is the achromatic contrast (delta
  L, in JNDs)

\description{
  Applies the visual models of Vorobyev et al. (1998) to
  calculate color distances with receptor noise based on
  relative photoreceptor densities.
